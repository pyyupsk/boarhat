**Support 2:** Truffle and Filbert
**Geniemon:** Luminelf

#### Why This Team Works

**Phoxhunter:**

**Alternative Geniemon: Ballbee (4★)**

## Combat Strategy & Rotation

### Pre-Fight Setup

1. Equip **Withershade** (Katana) + **Embla Inflorescence** (Pistol)
2. Ensure Skill Range is stacked to 150-200%+ before boss fights
3. Position yourself at mid-range to hit with both summons

### Standard Rotation (Farming)

```
1. Cast Lunar Hunt (wide AoE) to group enemies
2. Cast Solar Eclipse (concentrated burst)
3. Swap weapons → use ranged attacks to trigger Interwoven Cries
4. Repeat Lunar Hunt → Solar Eclipse chain
5. Use Ultimate when Sanity is full (120)
```

### Boss Burst Rotation

```
1. Build Sanity to 120 before engage
2. Activate Misty Sea Requiem (Ultimate)
3. Cast Lunar Hunt → Solar Eclipse → Lunar Hunt → Solar Eclipse (spam 6 total)
   - Skills are FREE during Funeral Rite!
   - Solar Eclipse deals 6,800% enhanced damage
4. Use ranged weapon attacks between skills (60% Trigger Prob boost)
5. After ultimate ends, return to standard rotation
```

### Advanced Tips

**Skill Range Stacking Strategy:**

- Aim for 200% Skill Range before ulting
- 100% excess converts to 100% Skill DMG during Funeral Rite
- Example: 200% Range → 100% bonus Skill DMG = 2x damage multiplier!

**Positioning:**

- Lunar Hunt has 10-13m radius → stand at edge to avoid damage
- Solar Eclipse has smaller radius → move closer for single-target burst
- Use Lunar Hunt's pull effect during ultimate to keep bosses centered

**Interwoven Cries Optimization:**

- Stack Trigger Probability to 50%+ (Entropic Singularity or Flamme De Epuration)
- Each skill cast has 50% chance to summon the opposite skill for free
- Creates chain reactions: Lunar → Solar → Lunar → Solar in rapid succession

**Sanity Management:**

- Don't waste Sanity before ultimate
- Scorch wedges reduce skill costs → more casts
- Wings Inspo restores 15 Sanity on kill → infinite sustain in mob packs

---

## Skill Priority (Upgrades)

1. **Lunar Hunt / Solar Eclipse** → MAX (highest damage gains)
2. **Misty Sea Requiem** → Level 10 (enhanced skills + Trigger Prob)
3. **Interwoven Cries** → Level 10 (50% proc rate is crucial)

---

---

## Progression Guide

### Early Game (Level 1-40)

**Focus:**

- Unlock Lunar Hunt/Solar Eclipse and level to 5
- Equip any 3★ Katana + Pistol with Slash ATK or Trigger Prob
- Use Cerberus wedges (3★) for basic stat boosts
- Learn skill placement and alternating summons

**Budget Weapons:**

- Katana: Momiji Itteki (neutral, common drop)
- Pistol: Rendhusk (Character ATK +120%)

### Mid Game (Level 40-65)

**Focus:**

- Max Lunar Hunt/Solar Eclipse (highest priority)
- Farm Phoenix • Skylume Wildfire (4★ version at Level 65)
- Obtain Embla Inflorescence if possible
- Begin stacking Skill Range (aim for 150%)

**Milestones:**

- Level 50: Unlock Ultimate (Misty Sea Requiem)
- Level 60: Can clear most world content
- Level 65: Unlock 4★ Demon Wedges

### Late Game (Level 65+)

**Focus:**

- Full 5★ Demon Wedge setup (forge duplicates)
- Refine Skill Range to 200%+ with Withershade + Embla
- Max all skills to Level 10
- Optimize Trigger Probability for Interwoven Cries
- Challenge Abyss/Boss content for top-tier rewards

**Endgame Goals:**

- Perfect roll Demon Wedges (tolerance values)
- Weapon Resonance upgrades (unlock higher refine ranks)
- Team synergy refinement (test different support combos)

---

## F2P Viability

**Rating: 9/10**

Lady Nifle is **extremely F2P-friendly** for a T0 character:

- ✅ **Event Weapons**: Both Withershade and Embla Inflorescence can be obtained through events
- ✅ **Farmable Wedges**: Phoenix and Typhon series available at Level 65
- ✅ **Self-Sufficient**: Doesn't require specific SSR supports to function
- ✅ **Long-Term Value**: Remains T0 in all content types
- ✅ **Flexible Build**: Multiple viable weapon combinations

The only premium investment is 5★ Demon Wedge forging, but 4★ versions work until endgame.

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- ❌ **Not stacking Skill Range**: You're missing 50-100% damage without proper Skill Range → DMG conversion
- ❌ **Using ultimate at low Skill Range**: Always ensure 150-200% Skill Range before Funeral Rite
- ❌ **Ignoring Trigger Probability**: Interwoven Cries passive is 40% of your DPS
- ❌ **Poor summon placement**: Skills are stationary—predict enemy movement
- ❌ **Spamming outside ultimate**: Sanity management is critical; save for burst windows
- ❌ **Neglecting Skill Efficiency**: High Sanity costs become unsustainable without Scorch wedges
